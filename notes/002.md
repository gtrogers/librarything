Adding a new method so we can explicitly check
that a given output occured at a given location

Notice how we add the method and tests first,
in a seperate commit, before using it anywhere.
This helps to keep the history of the code neat
and stops us changing too much at once.

Here we switch to using the new method and remove
the old one. It is important to remove code that
is no longer used to keep everything clear. We can
always get it back later from git if we need it later
