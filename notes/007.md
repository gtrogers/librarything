Now we are ready to add our new functionality to the app.

We un-ignore the test, watch it fail, and then wire in the
catalogue class to the app.

*Note - our stub input needs the inputs in reverse order, which is a bit annoying*

The test tells us that everything now works and that we can list the catalogue
from the main menu.
