#Tests and Choices

##https://github.com/gtrogers/librarything/commit/14a7897eedb92d2363f8be63f7900d615ac8b012

At this stage we have done the minimum to test that
the app starts and stops and does something we expect.

From a design point of view we know the app needs to
do the following things.

- Get input from the user
- Make a decision based on that input
- Output the results of that decision to the user

At the moment we have tested that the app can output
a message to the user.

We are using interfaces to swap out the actual output
mechanics for ones which are easier to test. This also
helps to maintain modularity and split up responsibilities.
