Now we add a failing end-to-end test which
describes what we expect to happen when
the user asks for the catalogue to be printed.

Important things to notice
- We introduce some new classes (catalogue and book)
- We sketch out what we expect them to do in the failing test
- We do not implement them yet, because we need to tests for this
- The app and the rest of the tests still run
- We mark this test as @ignore so it wont break the (hypothetical) build
- The next step (in a new commit) is to make this test pass by testing and implementing new functionality
