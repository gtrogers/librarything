Adding a test for the catalogue.
We use mocks so that the only behaviour we
are testing is that of the catalogue itself
(we do not want to be distracted by a possible
error in the book class).

We test the catalogue by asserting on
the intended functionality - printing a list of items

It is tempting to add a method to make testing
easier (like get size of catalogue) but as we
do not need that code in production we avoid doing
that.
