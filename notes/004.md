Adding a test for the catalogue.
We use mocks so that the only behaviour we
are testing is that of the catalogue itself
(we do not want to be distracted by a possible
error in the book class).

By using mocks we sketch out the external description (e.g. public methods) of
the book class without having to write it at this point.

We test the catalogue by asserting on
the intended functionality - printing a list of items

It is tempting to add a method to make testing
easier (like get size of catalogue) but as we
do not need that code in production we avoid doing
that.

Finally it is worth noting we do not use catalogue
anywhere yet. We wait until it is tested to plug it
into the code.
