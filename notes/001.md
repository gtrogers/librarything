At this stage we test the inputs. The app can
now start, ask for an input and then stop.

For testing purposes we have a stubInput
class where we can queue up inputs to
be fed into the app.

We can now write an 'end to end' test
which shows the full flow through the
application.

These tests are important because they
can be used to pinpoint where new tests
and classes are needed.
